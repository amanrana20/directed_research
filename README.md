**Why Lung Cancer ?**

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in both men and women, and is by far the leading cause of deaths casued by cancer among both the genders. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. Most lung cancers have already spread widely and are at an advanced stage when they are first found. These cancers are very hard to cure. Lung cancer can be treated if detected in early stages. [(Source)](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/lung-cancer/prevention-and-early-detection.html)

Most lung cancers are first diagnosed based on symptoms. Symptoms of lung cancer are not very specific and generally reflect damage to the lungsâ€™ ability to function normally. The most common symptoms are a worsening cough that will not go away, and chest discomfort. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, spitting up small amounts of blood, unexplained weight loss, back pain, loss of appetite, and a general fatigue. 

Unlike mammography for breast cancer or colonoscopy for colon cancer, a widely accepted screening tool for early-stage lung cancer has not been available until recently. Regular chest X-rays are not reliable enough to find lung tumors in their earliest stages, when many doctors believe the tumors are at their smallest and most curable state.

Recent guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncologists suggests annual screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for smokers and former smokers at high risk for developing lung cancer. High risk factors include being between the age of 55 to 74, having smoked for 30 years or more, and either continuing to smoke or having quit within the past 15 years. At this time, yearly screening with LDCT is recommended for high-risk individuals after careful discussion with their physicians.

Advances in the field of Deep Learning coupled with the low cost and availability of computing resources has propelled research in the area of Deep Learning based medical diagnosis. This research is one such endeavour. In this research I aim to detect lung cancer using low-dose CT scans. The dataset used for this research is publically available at [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) and [LUNA 2016 challenge](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/)


**Code on this Repository**

The code in this repository will contain all the attempts I make to get good accuracy. It will incude the failed attempts and the successful ones. I will try and find out why the attempts failed and post it here.
